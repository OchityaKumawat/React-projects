When you run `npx parcel index.html`, it will look for **`index.html` in the current directory**.

---

### Explanation:
1. **Current Working Directory**:
   - When you run the command `npx parcel index.html`, the terminal starts looking for `index.html` **from the folder where the command is executed**.
   - If you are currently in the root directory of your project (`ReactJS`), then **the terminal will find**:
     - `Chapter 1 - Inception/index.html`
     - `Chapter 2 - Ignition/index.html`

2. **Ambiguity**:
   - Since there are two `index.html` files, **Parcel** wonâ€™t automatically know which one you mean.
   - By default, if you run `npx parcel index.html`, it will look for an `index.html` **in the root folder** first.
   - If no `index.html` exists at the root level, the command will fail.

### How to Control Which File Runs?
You can **explicitly specify** the file path to avoid confusion.

#### Run Chapter 1 `index.html`:
```bash
npx parcel "Chapter 1 - Inception/index.html"
```

#### Run Chapter 2 `index.html`:
```bash
npx parcel "Chapter 2 - Ignition/index.html"
```

### Best Practices:
1. **Be Explicit**: Always specify the file path when you have multiple files with the same name.
2. **Clear Entry Points**: If youâ€™re focusing on Chapter 2 now, specify it directly.



Hereâ€™s the correct way to push your updated files (like `dist/`, `package.json`, etc.) onto GitHub step by step:

### Steps to Push the New Files to GitHub

1. **Check Status**: See which files have changed or been added.
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

   This will show:
   - Untracked files (new files like `dist/`, `.parcel-cache/`, etc.).
   - Modified files (changes to existing files).

2. **Add Specific Files**:
   To avoid unnecessary files being pushed (like `.parcel-cache`), **add only what you need**.

   Add the updated and new files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   If you want to add files one by one:
   ```bash
   git add "Chapter 2 - Ignition/index.html"
   git add "Chapter 2 - Ignition/App.js"
   git add dist/
   git add package.json
   git add package-lock.json
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**:
   Write a meaningful commit message describing what you added.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Chapter 2 - Ignition: Add dist folder, App.js, index.html, and update package.json"
   ```

4. **Check Remote Branch**:
   Confirm you are pushing to the correct remote branch:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```

   - You should see `main` or `master`. If not, switch to the correct branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     ```

5. **Push the Changes**:
   Push your changes to the remote GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

6. **Verify on GitHub**:
   Go to your GitHub repository and verify that:
   - New files (e.g., `Chapter 2 - Ignition`, `dist/`, etc.) are uploaded.
   - Changes are reflected.

### **Optional Step: Ignore Unwanted Files**
If you want to exclude files like `.parcel-cache/` or `node_modules/` (they are large and unnecessary in Git), add them to a `.gitignore` file.

1. Create a `.gitignore` file at the root of your project if it doesnâ€™t exist:
   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```

2. Add these lines to `.gitignore`:
   ```
   node_modules/
   .parcel-cache/
   dist/
   ```

3. Commit the `.gitignore` file:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Add .gitignore to exclude node_modules, dist, and parcel cache"
   git push origin main
   ```
